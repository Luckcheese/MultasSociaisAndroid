Multas Sociais app for Android

This is the multassociais.net app for Android devices. Currently targeted towards 2.2+, level 8 api.

This is still a very crude app with lots of work to be done. Here's a quick to do list:

- Create and apply visual identity for the app,
- Execute HTTP POST request in new thread, add spinner/progress bar feedback,
- Test/fix the image capture intent and the file generated by the camera,
- Fill year/month/date/day/hour/minute fields with picture timestamp,
- Upload geo coordinates (latitude and longitude)
